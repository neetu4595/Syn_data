**A Comparative Exploration of Two Diffusion Generative Models on Tabular Data synthesis**
===========================================================================================
This repository contains the python codes used in our paper. 
This paper is about the comparison of two Diffusion generative models on tabular data synthesis for healthcare datsets.
You can download the datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. [Obesity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition) and [Diabetes](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators).

The file [Syn_Obesity.ipynb](https://github.com/neetu4595/Syn_data/blob/main/Syn_Obesity.ipynb) provides the codes for generation of artificial data for Obesity dataset by using both the models i.e. TabSyn and TabDDPM. It also provides the deatils on the evaluation metrices and comparison between both models.
Whereas, file [Syn_Diabetes.ipynb](https://github.com/neetu4595/Syn_data/blob/main/Syn_Diabetes.ipynb) provides the codes for generation of artificial data for diabetes dataset by using both models and also details of evaluation metricesused.
