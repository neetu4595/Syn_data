**A Comparative Exploration of Two Diffusion Generative Models on Tabular Data synthesis**
===========================================================================================
This repository contains the python codes used in our paper. 

This paper is about the comparison of two Diffusion generative models on tabular data synthesis for healthcare datsets.
You can download the datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle.
